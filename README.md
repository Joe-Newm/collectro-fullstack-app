# Collectro Web App

This app is a collection of video games using the Rawg.io API. I'm currently testing and creating a web app with search, pagination, and pulling data with an API.

## Challenges / Things I Learned
- Debouncing - Initially my search bar made a request every letter typed in order to show results on the modal popup. I learned about the concept of debouncing in order to not send a request until the user has stopped typing for about half a second. This can greatly reduce the number of api requests being made by your app, and I was worried I'd reach my limit quick if I didn't implement this technique.
